## Two Types of LLMs
1. Base LLM
Predicts next word based on the training data

2. Instruction Tuned LLMs
Trained to follow instructions. These models are fine-tuned on instructions and often further refined using a technique called RLHF: Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback to make the system more able to follow instructions.
